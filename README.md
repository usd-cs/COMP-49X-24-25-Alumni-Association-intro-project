# COMP-49X-24-25-Alumni-Association-intro-project

The Alumni Association intro project is a web based discussion page where users can make posts and comment or like on other user's posts. 

## Installation
Clone Git repository to your local machine.

Run ```sh envsetup.sh``` if you do not have a proper Django-equipped virtual environment setup already. This command will create the environment, install Django on the environment, and start the environment.

If you have the environment already, run ```source env/bin/activate``` on Mac or ```env\\Scripts\\activate``` on Windows.

From here you can use the command ```cd backend``` and then ```sh run.sh dev``` or ```sh run.sh prod``` depending on if you want the development or production version of the server. 

## Usage

```python
1. Clone Repository 
2. Open Terminal 
3. in terminal do python manage.py runserver
4. access server from http://127.0.0.1:8000/
5. Navigate site as you wish
```
